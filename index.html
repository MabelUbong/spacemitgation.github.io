				<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
				<p class="fade-in">  
					Our mission is to recognise and discuss various space-based climate change mitigation methods that could possibly pave the way for a new frontier in saving our planet. This webpage examines 3 distinct innovative methods that could solve our climate crisis - space-based solar power, solar shields and agriculture. We bring to you a more contemporary approach to solving the climate change problem. As a collective, we have worked together to give you a deep dive into possible space-based mitigation strategies. The goal of this website is to examine the feasibility of looking to space to solve the climate change problem. Either scroll through the page and access the information in the order we thought best to present or use the navigation bar found at the top to jump to sections within the report. For any queries use the contact section found at the far left of the navigation bar.

					Sixty years ago, we pushed the boundaries of human and technological capabilities by  landing on the moon. As a result, space exploration became the forefront of science. The desire to explore what is beyond our planet and discover more about the universe became important in driving the future of human civilisation. Using space to our advantage has benefited mankind in many ways over the last few decades; we have sent thousands of satellites into orbit around earth, which allow us to transmit television signals, navigate to a desired location, communicate in-flight on airplanes, and study meteorological effects on a global scale<sup><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/">[1]</a></sup>. However, meteorological data obtained using satellites has shown concerning results. 
					</br></br>
					According to NASA, 37% of the Earth’s population will  be exposed to severe heat waves if Earth’s temperature were to increase by 2 degrees Celsius<sup><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/">[1]</a></sup>. Furthermore, this would result in 18% of insects, 16% of plants and 8% of vertebrates to have their climatically determined geographic range reduced by more than a half. The risks to human health, food security, water supply and economic growth will also increase significantly, with communities that heavily rely on agriculture being at the highest risk. Clearly, we have accelerated a serious problem which will have a detrimental impact on the future of human existence. Climate change has been becoming more and more noticeable in the last few decades, and it will continue to have a severe impact on our planet unless we do something to change this as soon as possible. 
					</br></br>
					This webpage aims to explore pathways to prevent climate change by assessing the feasibility and utility of space to tackle this rising dilemma by using 3 distinct climate change mitigation methods, namely space-based solar power, solar shields, and agriculture. A question we can pose to ourselves is - if we have managed to make use of space to benefit our lives in many different ways through the use of satellites (including examining the effects of climate change), can we go further and utilise it to tackle climate change? Furthermore, could this be achieved in the near future, or have we truly reached a point of no return? This webpage will argue whether or not space could assist in solving  the problem of climate change. Space has always been thought to be the work of rocket scientists or theoretical physicists in front of blackboards filled with inconceivable formulae. But space is everyone’s business. We strive to lend our knowledge of space to everyone, to better mankind on Earth or wherever they may travel. By combining this knowledge with the policies behind climate change, we hope to investigate strategies that will leave a better, lasting impact on future generations.
				</p>
				<h2>Why Space?</h2>
				<p>
					The world’s energy demand is the main driver of climate change, due to heavy use of non-renewable energy sources, specifically fossil fuels. It has been increasing exponentially, so much so that in 2050, we will require 2-3 times more than we do today<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10399-3">[2]</a></sup>. While transitions to renewable energy sources such as solar power and wind power have eased the demand for non-renewable energy, they have not solved the climate crisis. This implies that there needs to be a new emergence of a renewable energy source, and the discovery of new ideas. Space holds the solutions to climate change, but this alternative resource is only viable if we are politically and economically willing to reach them<sup><a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/what-are-satellites-used">[3]</a></sup>. It is obvious that there are technological advancements that must be made in order to implement space-based energy systems<sup><a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/what-are-satellites-used">[3]</a></sup>. However, what is not so obvious is that harnessing the energy of space will give us an effectively unlimited supply of renewable energy<sup><a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/what-are-satellites-used">[3]</a></sup>.
					</br></br>
					This website will examine the previously mentioned space-based climate mitigation methods, and recommend the most realistic method that could be implemented in the real world. The technologies discussed could also perhaps serve as feedback to solve other future world problems, having greater benefit to society and possibly leading to furthering space exploration.

			<h1>Space Based Solar Power</h1>
			<p>
				Solar power has already been proven to be an effective method of generating electricity on Earth as a renewable energy source alternative to burning fossil fuels and nuclear power. However, Earth-based solar power has several major drawbacks. This includes the fact that solar panels are not able to harness the sun’s energy constantly and uniformly throughout the year due to the day-night cycle on Earth. In addition, solar farms take up large amounts of land, which disturbes local ecosystems and uses space that could be used for other purposes<sup><a href="https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2018/10/dark-side-sun-avoiding-conflict-solar-energys-land-water-demands/">[7]</a></sup>. We are therefore motivated to consider whether moving from Earth-based solar power to space-based solar power would be a feasible and viable option in helping to address climate change...

						<a href="https://solartribune.com/solar-space-powering-international-space-station/">
							<img src="solar-space.jpg" height="400px" width="400px" class="art" alt="Space based solar module" style="margin-left:50px">
						</a>
						<p>
							This is because moving our solar power technology to space would eliminate the consequences of the day-night cycle, as a solar power satellite (with photovoltaic cells) can be launched into a position where there is a large and constant solar flux, meaning that it can continuously use the sun’s radiation to produce electricity. It would also mean that we would not have to use large amounts of land on Earth for solar farms, which would allow us to further combat climate change by planting more trees or growing crops in place of solar farms.
							</br></br>
							There are two main components that we need to consider in order to assess whether space-based solar power could be a realistic method of energy generation - 1) using a solar power satellite to convert solar energy into electricity, and 2) converting this electricity into radiation which can be wirelessly transmitted down to Earth. The solar power satellite can either - utilise photovoltaic cells to convert solar radiation into electricity, or extract energy from charged particles emitted by the sun (or other sources in space). While the former is more familiar to us as it is the same technology that is used in solar panels on Earth, the latter involves using a static solar sail to harvest energy from charged particles<sup><a href="references.html">[8]</a></sup>. 
						</p>

						<h2>Static solar sails</h2>
			
						<p>
							The two most important events from which we can extract energy using a static solar sail are solar wind and galactic cosmic rays. Solar wind is a stream of charged particles (consisting mainly of protons and electrons) that is ejected from the upper atmosphere of the sun. These charged particles can escape the sun due to the high temperatures in the upper atmosphere, giving them enough energy to overcome the sun’s gravitational field. Galactic cosmic rays are also streams of charged particles, which can originate from supernovae of massive stars, quasars and gamma ray bursts.
							</br></br>
							A static solar sail makes use of radiation pressure to remain stationary in space. This means that the force exerted on the solar sail by incident solar radiation counteracts the force due to gravity from the sun. Static solar sails produce electricity using charged particles in solar wind and cosmic rays in the following way. Solar sails contain two conducting copper sheets which are used to generate a strong electric field. When charged particles pass near the solar sail, they are attracted to it by the electric field it produces. The electrons that are deflected by the solar sail’s electric field are collected at a metallic receiver, resulting in an electrical current. Similarly, the positively-charged particles (e.g. protons) are directed at a single junction PIN diode made out of silicon. The collisions between the charged particles and the silicon diode generate an electrical current in a similar way to how photons incident on a photovoltaic cell generate a current.
							</br></br>
							The Earth’s magnetic field prevents charged particles from approaching the Earth’s surface, so static solar sails must be placed at a large distance away from Earth (millions of kilometres) to ensure that a sufficient amount of charged particles from cosmic rays and solar wind are being harnessed to produce electricity. Solar sails can be launched into orbit around the Earth using rockets. They can then utilise radiation pressure to propel themselves to the required positions closer to the sun, where cosmic ray and solar wind radiation is more significant.
							</br></br>
							A more detailed description of the functionality of a static solar sail can be found in this journal article<sup><a href="references.html">[8]</sup>: <a href="https://www.krishisanskriti.org/vol_image/01Jul2015100750Paper%207.pdf">Energy Harvesting From Solar Wind and Galactic Cosmic Rays</a> 
						</p>
						<h2>Wireless Power Transmission</h2>
						<p>
							While static solar sails can be implemented relatively easily given current technology, the main practical limitation to space-based solar power is the way in which the energy that is harnessed by a space solar system in the form of electricity is transmitted down to earth. In order to transmit the energy stored in space solar power systems down to earth, it must be beamed down as electromagnetic radiation. It is widely agreed that this radiation should be of the form of a 2.45 GHz microwave laser beam, as the attenuation through the atmosphere is extremely low for radiation of this frequency<sup><a href="references.html">[9]</a></sup>. 
							</br></br>
							The efficiency of transmitting electrical power wirelessly depends on the efficiency of the components used to transmit and receive the radiation, as well as on the ability to focus the beam onto a receiving rectenna<sup><a href="references.html">[10]</a></sup>. Transmitters in a space solar power system must be able to efficiently convert direct current (DC) power into radiofrequency (RF) power, and then radiate the power in a low loss manner. A rectenna must then efficiently convert this RF power back into DC power for use on earth. Even though rectennas with conversion efficiencies greater than 90% have been developed for 2.45 GHz radiation, the entire DC to DC wireless power transmission efficiency is approximated to be 45% over a transmission distance of 36,000 km. This is due to the fact a large number of losses accumulates in the system, in particular when a significant amount of the power is lost due to absorption and reflection of the laser beam as it travels from the solar power system down to earth. Moreover, the laser beam would have to be collected by a rectenna with a diameter of approximately 10km, as the transmission distance is so large that the beam would disperse greatly<sup><a href="references.html">[11]</a></sup>. Alternatively, we need to develop more superior laser technology, or huge lenses in space which would allow us to focus the laser beam onto receivers of smaller diameter on earth. 
							</br></br>
							More information on the technology involved in wireless power transmission can be found here<sup><a href="references.html">[10]</a></sup>: <a href="https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.sheffield.idm.oclc.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145675&tag=1">https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.sheffield.idm.oclc.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1145675&tag=1</a>
						</p>
						<h2>Costs associated with space solar power systems</h2>
						<p>
							In addition to considering the technological factors associated with space-based solar power, we need to evaluate whether moving from earth-based solar power to space-based solar power would be financially viable. A careful analysis<sup><a href="references.html">[12]</a></sup> of the costs associated with producing photovoltaic cells for use in solar power satellites and the costs associated with launching mass into orbit has shown that space-based solar power will only be able to financially compete with earth-based solar power if all of the below conditions are met:
							</br></br>
							- Solar power needs to meet approximately all of our electricity demand.
							</br>
							- The cost of space solar power photovoltaic arrays must be reduced to $1000 per peak kW (i.e. to the cost of earth-based arrays).
							</br>
							- Space solar power transmission must be no less efficient and no more expensive than storage and intercontinental transmission of electricity on earth.
							</br>
							- Space solar power system operation and maintenance costs cannot be higher than those for earth-based systems.
							</br>
							- The space-based system mass must be less than 5 kg per peak kW, and the launch cost must be less than $350 per kg.
							</br></br>
							Currently, photovoltaic arrays for space applications are about 500 times more expensive than those for earth-based applications (per peak kW). Furthermore, the current cost of sending mass in a low-earth orbit is approximately $10,000 per kg, which is much higher than the required maximum of $350 per kg. In addition, the space solar power system mass is currently greater than 10 kg per peak kW. Moreover, wireless power transmission from space is much less efficient than intercontinental transmission of electricity on earth, due to the fact that a significant fraction of power is lost as it is transmitted wirelessly using radiation over large distances in space (there would be significant absorption and reflection of the laser beam between the space solar power system and the receiver on earth, as mentioned previously). As a result, technological advances must still be made in terms of both space solar power systems and wireless power transmission for space-based solar power to be able to financially compete with earth-based solar power.
							</br></br>

						</p>
						<h2>The Dyson sphere - the ultimate superstructure? </h2>
						<p>
							An alternative to using solar power satellites such as a static solar sail is the hypothesised Dyson sphere<sup><a href="references.html">[13]</a></sup>. This is a megastructure proposed by Freeman Dyson, which would encompass a star and harness approximately 100% of its radiation energy. This energy would then be radiated down to earth in the same way as the energy stored in solar power satellites. Although theoretically possible, building a stable Dyson sphere around a star is currently far beyond our technological capabilities.

			<h1 id="shield">Solar Shielding</h1>
			<p>
				Another potential space-based solution for tackling climate change involves building a large shield to partially block out the sun's radiation. In order to counteract global warming most proposed solar shield projects suggest reducing the flux of the sun's radiation that the earth receives by 1.7%<sup><a href="references.html">[14]</a></sup>. There are two main proposals for solar shield applications: a solar shield near the L1 Lagrange point<sup><a href="references.html">[14]</a></sup>, and a ring of solar shields around our planet<sup><a href="references.html">[15]</a></sup>...

				<h2> Shield at the L1 Lagrange Point </h2>
				<p>
					A solar shield can be placed near the point at which the force of gravity from the sun and earth cancel each other out - this is known as the L1 Lagrange point. The actual location of the shield would need to be modified slightly from this point due to the radiation pressure from the sun. It has been proposed that by using a refracting material to deflect the sun's radiation away from earth rather than absorbing it will minimise this effect<sup><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0608163103">[16]</a></sup>. There are a few ways of forming this solar shield - it could either be composed of a single, large shield<sup><a href="references.html">[14]</a></sup>, several smaller shields<sup><a href="references.html">[14]</a></sup>, or a cloud of many small shields<sup><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0608163103">[16]</a></sup>. If we were to use one large shield, there is a simple equation which we can use to calculate the required radius of the shield:
		 			</br>
		 		</p>
		 		<img src="radius-equation.png" alt="Equation to calculate the radius of the supposed shield" style="margin-left:50px;">
		 		<p style="text-align: left;">
		 			</br></br></br></br>
					In this equation, Rshield is the radius of the solar shield, Rsun is the radius of the sun, Dshield is the distance from the earth to the shield, Dsun is the distance from the earth to the sun, 𝝙S is the reduction in received flux on the earth's surface, and S is the total flux received on earth's surface. The value calculated for the L1 lagrange point is Rshield = 2,600 km<sup><a href="references.html">[14]</a></sup>. While this corresponds to a huge solar shield size, it is a project on a similar scale to some large-scale projects undertaken on earth such as the Three Gorges Dam in China<sup><a href="references.html">[14]</a></sup>. However, constructing one large solar shield could have a large impact on life on earth. A network of smaller solar shields would offer a greater degree of control over their effects, while also being more feasible in their production. Different configurations of these smaller shields would lead to different effects on different areas of our planet, potentially allowing us to optimise the climate across the earth to suit the needs of wildlife and human civilisation. Nevertheless, there is little research in this area and more work must be done with more advanced climate models.
					</br></br>
					More information on using a single, large solar shield at the L1 Lagrange point to partially block out some of our sun’s radiation can be found here<sup><a href="references.html">[14]</a></sup>:<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136648"> Optimal Sunshade Configurations for Space-Based Geoengineering near the Sun-Earth L1 Point </a>
					</br></br>
					The optimal solution for utilising solar shields at the L1 Lagrange point may be to deploy a cloud of small spacecraft<sup><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0608163103">[16]</a></sup>. These would have the controllability that is important to carefully regulate our climate and would also be easier to place into position due to their smaller size. It is proposed that electromagnetic propulsion could be used to launch the spacecraft, and ionic propulsion could power them to their final position at the L1 Lagrange point. In order to create the desired cooling effect on earth it is estimated that the total mass of spacecraft needed is 20 million tonnes, with each launch being able to carry 1 tonne of mass. This would result in the need for 20 million launches, costing approximately $600 billion. In addition, there would also be associated production costs, which are estimated at $50 per kg of spacecraft. This places the initial production cost at $1 trillion. After including operations costs and the cost of replacing damaged spacecraft in the cloud, this cost rises to $5 trillion over a proposed 50 year lifespan of the project<sup><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0608163103">[16]</a></sup>.
					</br></br>
					A more detailed discussion of using a cloud of spacecraft at the L1 Lagrange point can be found here:<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/103/46/17184"> Feasibility of cooling the Earth with a cloud of small spacecraft near the inner Lagrange point (L1) </a>	
				</p>
				<h2> Ring of Solar Shields Around Earth </h2>
				<p>
					A potentially cheaper alternative to a solar shield at the L1 Lagrange point is to create a ring of shields around the earth. This ring could be composed of either artificial spacecraft (as mentioned above), or natural materials such as fragments of asteroids<sup><a href="references.html">[15]</a></sup>. The biggest drawback of this solution is the huge increase in the number of objects orbiting around the earth. This has the consequence of creating more space junk that can damage satellites, while also making it more dangerous to leave our planet for space exploration purposes.
					</br></br>
					In terms of artificial spacecraft, a similar design of spacecraft to the proposed solution discussed above can be used to create a ring around the earth. It has been estimated that, in order to achieve the target of reducing the solar flux on earth by 1.7%, a total mass of approximately 5 million tonnes of spacecraft would be required<sup><a href="references.html">[15]</a></sup>. While this mass is significant, it is still much smaller than the mass required for a cloud of shields at the L1 Lagrange point. They will also be controllable, which means that we can fine-tune the effect that the shield has on our planet down to a region-by-region basis. Another benefit of this is the fact that this would be a completely reversible process, should it have negative effects on our climate<sup><a href="references.html">[15]</a></sup>. In addition, this spacecraft could be used for other purposes, such as generating electricity through solar power. This energy production could potentially offset the cost of putting these satellites into orbit.
					</br></br>
					The alternative to using spacecraft is to create the solar shield ring out of natural materials in space. These materials could come from asteroids, our moon, or earth itself. Taking this material from a source in space would reduce the costs associated with waste material from asteroid mining or terraforming on the moon being used. However, this space-based solution has several drawbacks<sup><a href="references.html">[15]</a></sup>. Firstly, natural material is less mass efficient than spacecraft with a greater total mass of 2 billion tonnes required to obtain the same shielding effect. Secondly, this solution could result in increased meteor showers, posing a greater risk to satellites orbiting the earth. Thirdly, the lack of controllability of such natural materials would lead to irreversible effects, should it cause harm to our planet. Furthermore, this material would partially reflect light from the sun, increasing the brightness of the night sky, in turn negatively affecting earth's nocturnal wildlife.
					</br></br>
					A more detailed discussion of using artificial and natural solar shields around earth can be found here: <a href="https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-98c20472-748f-3a98-b5e3-d2a811dcd151"> Earth rings for planetary environment control </a>	
				</p>
				<h2> Political and Economical Viability </h2>
				<p>
					As we continue to miss out on climate action goals, more ambitious solutions to climate change such as solar shields become more attractive. Furthermore, the cost of such projects is within reach of some of the world's most powerful nations such as the USA and China<sup><a href="references.html">[17]</a></sup>.  As mentioned previously, the cost of a cloud of spacecraft at the L1 Lagrange point is approximated at $5 trillion over a 50 year lifespan. This equates to an annual spend of  $100 billion<sup><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0608163103">[16]</a></sup>. While this is a significant sum, it still fits well within the USA’s 2020 military budget of $778 billion<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/262742/countries-with-the-highest-military-spending/">[18]</a></sup>. Undertaking this project would have many benefits to the nation in question - it would result in an increase in political power on the international stage, with other nations depending on that country for reaching their climate action ambitions. Other nations may also bid to contribute to the solar shield, in a similar way to early human spaceflight<sup><a href="references.html">[17]</a></sup>. This project would also greatly increase the pace of human development and encourage economic development and human settlement in the space frontier. The country undertaking this project would be in a prime position to lead the way in this new area for human development.
					</br></br>
					In summary, there are multiple ways a solar shield could be implemented, from a single, large shield at the L1 lagrange point to a planetary ring of satellites around the earth. Some methods are more realistic (such as a cloud of spacecraft at the L1 point), while others feature too many drawbacks (such as a ring of natural space materials). While some reports estimate costs, very little research has been carried out in this area to date. Therefore, these cost estimates are unlikely to be accurate. More research is needed in order to fully determine the feasibility of a solar shield. Based on present research, we can conclude that the money needed to carry out a solar shield project would be better used on another, better researched method of combating the climate crisis.

			<h1 id="agr">Agriculture</h1>
			<p>
				In addition to space-based solar power and solar shields, another option for utilising space to combat climate change involves moving agriculture to space. Earth’s trees, plants and green life are being exhausted. Finding ways of growing such plantations outside of our atmosphere for resource farming may be helpful to sustaining life here on earth. Whether it be on the ground or in the air, we should look at any way of using what is available outside of our atmosphere to combat climate change...

					Soil on Mars and the moon is surprisingly fertile, containing soil, clay minerals, salts, along with much needed nutrients such as phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen. Concentrating on smaller plants such as rice, soybeans, sweet potatoes, and green vegetables, we hope to allow for simple yet nutritious meals whilst also testing what could be grown in such harsh environments. More testing on larger portions of this soil can only tell whether this is truly a viable option.
					</br></br>
					This plan will undoubtedly open far more land to grow consistent plant life, and will help farm life thrive further. It is the hope that scientists can develop plants in these cold and droughted regions, that they could survive even in the toughest areas of earth. This means that more space on earth that is not capable of habiting humans could be used to cultivate life, life that could sustain not just us, but our atmosphere. Furthermore, an extension of this plan could include bringing soil samples back down to earth to help nurture land that may not be able to house life without extra care. Not only will these plants be able to be used as plantations for astronauts when exploring these regions, rather than transporting extra resources out into space for them, but these plants could be used for people on earth in the long run. 
					</br></br>
					Deforestation and the shrinking of green land for necessary resources across the globe has always been an issue. The removal of carbon in trees has been looked at to be a dominant source of carbon dioxide releasing into the atmosphere, with an estimated 23-44% increase in carbon in the atmosphere being sourced from deforestation. Looking for alternative places to grow expendable green land would be key to preventing climate change, allowing for more plants to grow across the world.
	  				</br></br>
					Though genetically modified plants are a risk, they have been used in our food source for centuries and have been experimented for longer. The main issue is several technologies should be developed before this could become a reality. Currently developing technologies include mass and actively cooled LED lighting systems, which lack reliability or durability. These would be used as a good source of temperature regulation based on the solar light absorbed. Another issue is water recovery, as research into recycling water is still undergoing. The biggest issue of all is the development of these plants themselves. The other problems this plan has involve the lack of reactive nitrogen; though nitrogen is present, it is not in the forms most useful to plantation, such as NO3 and NH4. This is easily solvable by transporting nitrogen-fixing species.

				<h2>Challenges of Agriculture in Space</h2>
				<p>
					The main reason space agriculture could be unachievable would be the budgeting this project would require. At present, considered variables would include: the agriculture and research development, the transportation costs, and the habitation of agricultural life once in space. Transportation to and from the moon could cost between $100-500 million per launch, pending on various factors such as weight, reliability, and payload. This would be the main expenditure of the budget. The cost to build a farm could be upwards of $60,000 per square foot. Figures for an appropriate base, research and personnel would vary depending on the scenario, and therefore this is not possible to estimate well without more physical information.
					</br></br>
					It seems as though direct agriculture is not a viable option in mitigating the climate crisis, but there are other potential methods that can be used, namely space mining . These space-based energy systems will provide energy for the world but it will also need funding globally <sup><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/">[1]</a></sup>.
				</p>
				<h2>Space Mining</h2>
				<p>
					Another possible solution is building equipment that can extract helium-3 that contains two protons and one neutron and other volatiles (chemical elements and compounds with low boiling points)  from the moon’s soil which is known as regolith <sup><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/harnessing-power-from-the-moon) https://www.nasa.gov/feature/harnessing-power-from-the-moon">[19]</a></sup>. The moon contains volatiles such as hydrogen, water and carbon dioxide which are found in areas of the moon such as craters that are near the moon’s south pole <sup><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/harnessing-power-from-the-moon) https://www.nasa.gov/feature/harnessing-power-from-the-moon">[19]</a></sup>. The science behind harnessing energy from the moon’s soil involves extracting the volatile materials that can be used in nuclear fusion reactors and the power generated could be exported.
					</br></br>
					Helium-3 is rare on earth because the earth is protected by but abundant on the Moon<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>. There is at least a million tons of helium-3 in the lunar regolith that was created four billion years ago due to being bombarded by solar wind <sup><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/harnessing-power-from-the-moon">[19]</a></sup>. Lunar solar volatiles extraction system world by embedding helium ions<sup><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/harnessing-power-from-the-moon) https://www.nasa.gov/feature/harnessing-power-from-the-moon">[19]</a></sup>. A more detailed analysis of the strategy of mining the moon surfaces can be seen in the video below (interestingly enough this was talked about in the 90s!), also found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0O5SGeiSEw[nine]">here</a>:

					</br></br>
					A similar solution such as biomining can also be utilised. It is the process where power is harnessed from tiny microbes<sup><a href="www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190723163927.htm">[21]</a></sup>. The process is proven to be effective in zero-gravity environments<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>. Biomining essentially provides a way to obtain materials from celestial bodies without bringing them back to earth. Biomining utilizes an in-situ approach, however biomining outside of Earth’s atmosphere  is very different as microbes and rocks interact differently [one]. Microbes reproduce if you give them food, they are energy efficient<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>. Did you know that 35% of the copper in the world is extracted from rocks using microbes<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>? So, biomining is not a new phenomenon<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>.

					Rare earth elements (REEs) such as lanthanides, scandium andyttrium are used in mobile phones, computer screens due to their physical properties<sup><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.641387/full">[25]</a></sup>. REEs demand will soon surpass the supply on earth<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19276-w">[22]</a></sup>. Figure 3 shows how much REEs are on the moon compared to the earth, further highlighting the need of space mining. We all know that the preferred method of limiting climate change involves reducing emission of carbon dioxide<sup><a href="https://microbiologysociety.org/publication/past-issues/life-on-a-changing-planet/article/climate-change-microbes-to-the-rescue.html">[23]</a></sup>. Since microbes control and condition global scale geochemical cycles (this is what every life form on earth is governed by) we can use our knowledge about them to our advantage<sup><a href="https://microbiologysociety.org/publication/past-issues/life-on-a-changing-planet/article/climate-change-microbes-to-the-rescue.html">[23]</a></sup>. However, biomining in space relies on the movement of fluid, in microgravity fluid can’t move that easily as there is no convection or sedimentation<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>. Thus, microgravity influences microbial processes<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19276-w">[22]</a></sup>. But research has shown that microorganisms can mobilise REEs from rock<sup><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.641387/full">[25]</a></sup>. But more research needs to be done into harnessing the power of biomining beyond Earth. We need to gain knowledge on how microgravity influences growth and metabolic processes<sup><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.641387/full">[25]</a></sup>.
				</p>
				<h2>Cost and Benefit Associated with Space Mining</h2>
				<p>
					Mining beyond earth could help advance our understanding of the use of regolith and microbes in biofuels<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19276-w">[22]</a></sup>. But both have their cost and benefits, which will now be laid out.
					</br></br>
					Nuclear fusion can utilise helium-3 so this could easily be a good solution for the climate change crisis<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>. In addition to this there is a market for helium-3, which can be part of the power portfolio of Earth<sup><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/harnessing-power-from-the-moon) https://www.nasa.gov/feature/harnessing-power-from-the-moon">[19]</a></sup>. However, there has been little research into lunar helium-3 mining even though this has been a major reason to return back to the moon for an end-to-end mission<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>.The end-to-end mission involves mining 200 tons of helium-3 (every year) on the Moon and returning it to Earth which would meet 10% of the global energy demand by 2040<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>.The mission is very large so it has been estimated that only 0.1% and 1% of the global energy demand in 2040 can be met realistically<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>. The mission is technically challenging and complex, however the only technologies needed already exist or just need to be developed<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>.
					</br></br>
					The end-to-end mission would involve using novel and conservative concepts<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>. Below gives the key requirements, cost and profit of such a mission:
					</br>
					- 1,700 - 2,000 helium-3 vehicles would be required using ‘Wisconsin’s Mark III miner’<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>.
					</br>
					- Cost: 427.7 - 1,347.9 billion Euro<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>.
					</br>
					- Profit: -724.0 to 260.0 billion Euro<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>.
					</br></br>
					It is important to note that lunar helium is unsuitable to provide a large amount of the percentage of the global energy demand in 2040<sup><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E1515K/abstract">[20]</a></sup>. But what about biomining? Well, demonstrating that biomining can be adapted to function in interstellar space (where there are environmental constraints) is the challenge<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup> as discussed before. There will be a need to check the effectiveness of technological innovation and the viability financially. Fortuentley, efforts have been made by testing mining on the Moon done by the University of Edinburgh<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>. The downside is that this research has been done using a small apparatus, and is not scaled up to a biomining experiment<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>. Based on this biomining seems like a more viable option than mining helium-3.
					</br></br>
					As a whole space mining is financial, technological and logistical attractive<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>. Human mineral needs could be met using space mining. There is actually a 400% improvement rate of recovery of precious minerals using biomining<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>. Even though all of this sounds great, the scientific community is interested in using space for scientific exploration but this vision is not shared with private companies that are driven by innovation that could lead to profitability<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>. Well-established groups such as NASA (provide financial and technical backing) along with private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin are the drivers of innovation<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>. But a new question comes to rise, in the ethicality of exploiting space for its resources. Even if these stakeholders come together and realise space mining into reality is there another chance that we could destroy space too? Or is saving our planet worth it using this novel approach, can space mining that was once fiction can be realised in reality and will it be worth it?<sup><a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/the-final-frontier-could-biomining-be-the-future-of-resource-extraction-in-space/">[24]</a></sup>

		<h1 id="conc"> Concluding Thoughts </h1>
		<p>
			Space-based solar power, solar shields and agriculture are all theoretically possible solutions for tackling climate change on earth through the use of space. However, each of these solutions comes with technological and financial barriers, with some implementation options potentially having unwanted effects on life on earth. We are in a position to be able to extract energy from our sun’s radiation and charged particles using satellites in space with current technology, and this would reduce our reliance on polluting fossil fuels as well as land on earth for large-scale solar farms. However, using wireless power transmission to transmit the harnessed energy from space solar power systems down to earth poses a significant technological challenge. Alternatively, using solar shields would allow us to reverse global warming by partially blocking out our sun’s radiation, resulting in a cooling effect. However, this option comes with many uncertainties and drawbacks, including unprecedented effects on our climate which would not be compensated by the reduction in global warming. Finally, moving agriculture to space would reduce our dependence on land on earth, which would significantly decrease global warming effects caused by deforestation. Nevertheless, many technological developments must still be made for us to be able to sustain large-scale plantations in space over long periods of time.
			</br></br>
			The research that has been carried out to date on the solutions we have considered shows that space-based solar power would be the most financially viable option for combating climate change using space. Solar shield and space agriculture implementation projects are estimated to cost millions/billions of dollars due to the large transportation costs resulting from large amounts of mass that must be sent into space. On the other hand, using solar power satellites would require launching much smaller amounts of mass into space, which leads to much smaller launch costs. An in-depth analysis of the costs associated with producing and maintaining space solar power systems has shown that space-based solar power can compete with earth-based solar power, provided that we reduce the costs of launching mass into orbit from $10,000 per kg to $350 per kg, and that space-based systems become no more expensive to produce and maintain than earth-based systems. While technological advancements must still be made to reach the required financial figures and to efficiently transmit energy from space down to earth using wireless power transmission, the target is not out of reach and could be achieved within the next few decades if more extensive research is carried out in this field.
